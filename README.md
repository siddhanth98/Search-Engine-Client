## Installation
For running the search engine client, first install the latest Node JS 64-bit version for Windows from this page - [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This should install npm along with it.

Then from the root folder of the project i.e. `Search-Engine-Client`, run `npm install`. This will install all required dependencies specified in the package.json file for starting the React client.
Then from the same directory, run `npm start`. This will start the webpack dev server on `http://localhost:8080` where the client page can be accessed.
